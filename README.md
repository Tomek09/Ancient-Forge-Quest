# Ancient-Forge-Quest

I decided to use a simple MVVM pattern, the project was based heavily (almost entirely) on the UI so it was the most pleasant solution, combining this with the R3 package made the work enjoyable.

I based the whole thing on SO, they are easily modular and can be done quickly with Google Sheets for example

I could have done the project better.
